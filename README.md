### Description:

**I have developed a comprehensive online academy website that allows users to create and manage courses, which can then be assigned to teachers. Any registered user, categorized into three roles - Student, Teacher, or Admin - can purchase these courses.**

**For each course, there is a dedicated group where users can initiate discussions and share content related to that specific course. Other users have the ability to comment on these posts, fostering collaborative learning and interaction within the community.**

### The website's primary users are divided into three roles:

* **Students: These users can enroll in courses, participate in group discussions.**
* **Teachers: Teachers have the capability to manage courses, and engage in discussions within the course groups.**
* **Admins: Administrators hold the highest level of authority. They oversee the entire platform, they can create, update, delete any course, any community, and any user.**

**This online academy website facilitates the creation, management, and consumption of educational content while fostering a vibrant learning community through discussions and interactions.**
